### Introduction: GettingCleaningData

This repository is for the Coursera Course.  The project was to collect 
information from 3 sets of files, merge them, and finally to create results as a csv text file.
The R file is named run_analysis.R.

### Steps in the assignment

Data to be used was downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.  
As a zip file, copy the files and folders starting from UCI HAR Dataset.  This would include the 4 files, and be the folders named test and train, 
and they should be copied to a sub-folder in your R working directory, named data.

The assignment is broken down into the following 5 sections.

1.  Data files from the training and the test sets are merged to create one data set.
2.  Only data columns of mean and standard deviation are to be used 
3.  A file is imported with the actual text description of the activites, and applied
4.  Descriptive variable names are applied as necessary
5.  A tidy data set with the average of each column is written out as a csv text file

The R code sections are listed by the Assignment number, then the various steps are labeled as "Steps".
